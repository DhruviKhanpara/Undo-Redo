## üí° How Undo/Redo Works

Instead of using Swing‚Äôs built-in `UndoManager`, this project maintains two `Stack<String>` structures:

- **Undo**: Stores text changes
- **Redo**: Restores undone changes

### Example Logic

- When typing: new content is pushed to the **Undo** stack.
- On `Ctrl + Z` or clicking **Undo**:
  - Top of the **Undo** stack is moved to **Redo**.
  - Text area resets to the previous state (`texts` + last undo state).
- On `Ctrl + Y` or clicking **Redo**:
  - Top of the **Redo** stack is moved back to **Undo**.
  - Text area reflects the redone change.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Undo/Redo works on **full text segments**, not individual characters.
- Only supports `.txt` files (no rich-text or other formats).
- Font, color, and theme settings are not saved with files.
- Basic error handling (e.g., file read/write failures).
